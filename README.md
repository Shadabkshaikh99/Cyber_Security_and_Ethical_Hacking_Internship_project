# Cyber_Security_and_Ethical_Hacking_Internship_project
This project is a cybersecurity and ethical hacking implementation designed to test and enhance security mechanisms. It includes penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and security automation techniques. The goal is to identify security flaws and suggest remediation strategies to strengthen system defenses.

 Features
🔍 Vulnerability Scanning – Uses tools like Nmap, Nessus, or OpenVAS to detect security loopholes.
🔑 Password Cracking – Implements brute-force and dictionary attacks using tools like Hydra or John the Ripper.
🌐 Web Security Testing – Scans for SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF vulnerabilities in web applications.
🏴‍☠️ Penetration Testing – Simulates real-world attack scenarios using Metasploit, Burp Suite, and custom scripts.
🛡 Network Security Analysis – Monitors and analyzes network traffic using Wireshark and Snort.
🧑‍💻 Automation Scripts – Python/Bash scripts for automating reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation tasks.
